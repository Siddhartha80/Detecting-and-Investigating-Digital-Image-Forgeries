# Detecting-and-Investigating-Digital-Image-Forgeries

In today's digital era, the ease of manipulating images using various software tools has given rise to a growing concern regarding the authenticity of digital visual content. Image forgeries, whether for malicious intent or innocent retouching, pose significant challenges to trustworthiness in digital media. This project explores the field of image forensics, a specialized domain of digital forensics, focusing primarily on the detection and identification of image forgeries. The main objective of image forensics is to investigate and determine whether a digital image has been manipulated or forged. This project delves into the techniques and methodologies employed to achieve this goal, including both classical and state-of-the-art approaches, covering common manipulations like copy-move, splicing, and retouching, and advanced techniques such as deepfake generation. The project emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying principles and characteristics of digital images to detect these manipulations effectively.
